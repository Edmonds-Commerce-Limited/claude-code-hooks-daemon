# Niggles ledger seventeen: write-ups

Newest first. Each entry says how it was found, why it happens, and the
candidate remedies. Numbering continues from
[ledger sixteen](../00466-niggles-ledger-sixteen/NIGGLES.md).

### N262 — the release procedure has no check that the notes fit a GitHub release body

**Found**: publishing v3.67.0, `gh release create --notes-file RELEASES/v3.67.0.md`
failed with HTTP 422, "body is too long (maximum is 125000 characters)". The notes
were 126,003 bytes because Step 5 folds every holding-area callout into the notes
verbatim, and this release carried 97 of them. Nothing in RELEASING.md, the release
agent or `invoke.sh` measures the notes against that cap, so the first sign is a
failure at publish time, after the tag is already pushed.

**Handled for this release**: the GitHub body is the notes with the verbatim
Highlights replaced by a link to that section at the tag (14,301 characters). The
committed `RELEASES/v3.67.0.md` is unchanged. Every callout is also a **Changes** entry.

**Candidate remedy**: the release agent writes the GitHub body itself, with the same
substitution once the notes pass the cap, and a test pins the body under 125,000
characters before Step 14 runs.

**Status**: ✅ Remedied in `ea8dcd542`. `scripts/release/build_github_release_body.py`
writes the body (notes unchanged when they fit, Highlights replaced by a link when they
do not, exit 1 if still over 125,000). RELEASING.md Step 14 and the Manual Release
block, the release skill's `invoke.sh` and the release agent run it BEFORE the tag and
give `gh release create` its output. Pinned by
`tests/integration/test_build_github_release_body.py`.
