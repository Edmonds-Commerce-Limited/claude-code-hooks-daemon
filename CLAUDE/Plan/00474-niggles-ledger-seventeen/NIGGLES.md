# Niggles ledger seventeen: write-ups

Newest first. Each entry says how it was found, why it happens, and the
candidate remedies. Numbering continues from
[ledger sixteen](../00466-niggles-ledger-sixteen/NIGGLES.md).

### N264 — a sub-agent's edits landed, uncommitted, in another branch's worktree

**Found**: dispatching a Sonnet agent to land `worktree-n466-n253`, its clean-tree
check failed. Three files in that worktree (`secret_file_guard.py`,
`secret_file_matching.py`, `test_secret_file_guard.py`) held 253 added lines,
all written in the same second, 08:22:51 UTC on 2026-09-30. The branch's reflog
had not moved for 20 hours, the shared stash was empty, and only this session's
`claude` process was running. So the writer was a sub-agent of this session. The
only one active then was the agent landing `worktree-n466-n101`, which was
working on the same guard in its own worktree. Which tool call wrote them is not
established.

**Why it matters**: the edits were the unapproved "warn, don't block" change for
`secret_file_guard`, with a dated owner-ruling comment. Committed by the next
landing agent, they would have reached `main` under the wrong branch's name.
Nothing in the daemon stops a sub-agent writing outside the worktree it was
given.

**Handled**: the edits are kept as `untracked/briefs/n253-unattributed-warn-dont-block.diff`
and reverse-applied, so the worktree matched its branch again. The landing brief
now says to write only inside the agent's own worktree.

**Candidate remedy**: a PreToolUse guard that, for a sub-agent whose working
directory is a linked worktree, denies a Write/Edit into a DIFFERENT linked
worktree of the same repository.

**Status**: ⬜ Open.

### N263 — the release empties UNRELEASED/post-upgrade-tasks/ but not its README's task index

**Found**: CI on the v3.67.0 release commit `e55c2ea28` (run 36662494834) failed
on all three Python versions, in two tests in
`tests/integration/test_repo_hygiene_check.py`, both rule `post-upgrade-index-drift`.
Step 6 moved the five `NN-*.md` task files out of
`CLAUDE/UPGRADES/UNRELEASED/post-upgrade-tasks/`, but that directory's
README kept its five index rows, which now named files that are not there.
RELEASING.md Step 6 said how to fill the versioned guide's index, but not to empty
the UNRELEASED one. No QA run between Step 6 and the tag caught it.

**Consequence**: the `v3.67.0` tag carries the stale index. It is a documentation
row in the repository, not daemon behaviour, and the published assets are
unaffected. The tag is not moved.

**Status**: ✅ Remedied. The UNRELEASED README's index is back to the
`_No tasks are queued for the next release._` placeholder, and RELEASING.md Step 6
now has an "Empty the UNRELEASED task index" step, with the hygiene test added to
its Verify block. The hygiene test already pins the invariant; the gap was procedural.

### N262 — the release procedure has no check that the notes fit a GitHub release body

**Found**: publishing v3.67.0, `gh release create --notes-file RELEASES/v3.67.0.md`
failed with HTTP 422, "body is too long (maximum is 125000 characters)". The notes
were 126,003 bytes because Step 5 folds every holding-area callout into the notes
verbatim, and this release carried 97 of them. Nothing in RELEASING.md, the release
agent or `invoke.sh` measures the notes against that cap, so the first sign is a
failure at publish time, after the tag is already pushed.

**Handled for this release**: the GitHub body is the notes with the verbatim
Highlights replaced by a link to that section at the tag (14,301 characters). The
committed `RELEASES/v3.67.0.md` is unchanged. Every callout is also a **Changes** entry.

**Candidate remedy**: the release agent writes the GitHub body itself, with the same
substitution once the notes pass the cap, and a test pins the body under 125,000
characters before Step 14 runs.

**Status**: ✅ Remedied in `ea8dcd542`. `scripts/release/build_github_release_body.py`
writes the body (notes unchanged when they fit, Highlights replaced by a link when they
do not, exit 1 if still over 125,000). RELEASING.md Step 14 and the Manual Release
block, the release skill's `invoke.sh` and the release agent run it BEFORE the tag and
give `gh release create` its output. Pinned by
`tests/integration/test_build_github_release_body.py`.
