# Plan 00021: Language-Specific Hook Handlers

**Status**: Not Started
**Created**: 2026-01-30
**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Architecture / Feature
**GitHub Issue**: #12

## Overview

Eliminate DRY violations in QA suppression and TDD enforcement handlers by implementing LanguageConfig-based architecture for multi-language project support.

## Problem

Current state:
- Four separate QA suppression handlers share 80% identical code
- TDD enforcement is Python-only (hardcoded .py extensions)
- Adding new languages requires copying entire handler files

## Solution

LanguageConfig data class + generic base handler pattern:
- LanguageConfig dataclass with language-specific patterns/conventions
- Generic QaSuppressionBlockerBase parameterized by LanguageConfig
- Generic TddEnforcementBase parameterized by LanguageConfig
- Thin concrete handler wrappers for registry compatibility

## Architecture

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class LanguageConfig:
    name: str
    extensions: tuple[str, ...]
    qa_forbidden_patterns: tuple[str, ...]
    test_file_pattern: str
    # ... other language-specific config
```

## Implementation Plan

**Full detailed plan with 6 phases including LanguageConfig design, generic base handlers, and language registry was generated by Opus agent (agentId: a8c00bf).**

See agent output above and GitHub Issue #12 for complete architecture design, file changes summary, and implementation phases.

## Next Steps

1. Create LanguageConfig dataclass and language registry
2. Implement generic QA suppression base
3. Refactor existing handlers to use base
