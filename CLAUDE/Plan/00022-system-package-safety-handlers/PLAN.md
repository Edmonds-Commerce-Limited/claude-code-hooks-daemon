# Plan 00022: System Package Safety Handlers

**Status**: Not Started
**Created**: 2026-01-30
**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Feature
**GitHub Issue**: #11

## Overview

Implement 5 safety handlers to block dangerous system package management patterns that Claude Code should never execute autonomously.

## Handlers

1. **PipBreakSystemHandler** (Priority 10, Terminal)
   - Blocks: `pip install --break-system-packages`
   - Reason: Corrupts system Python installation

2. **SudoPipHandler** (Priority 10, Terminal)
   - Blocks: `sudo pip install`
   - Reason: Modifies system Python, breaks OS tools

3. **CurlPipeShellHandler** (Priority 10, Terminal)
   - Blocks: `curl ... | bash`, `wget ... | sh`
   - Reason: Executes untrusted remote code without review

4. **DangerousPermissionsHandler** (Priority 15, Terminal)
   - Blocks: `chmod 777`, `chmod a+rwx`
   - Reason: Creates security vulnerabilities

5. **GlobalNpmAdvisorHandler** (Priority 40, Non-Terminal)
   - Advises on: `npm install -g`
   - Suggests: `npx` alternative

## Implementation Plan

**Full detailed plan with 9 phases, regex patterns, handler specifications, and TDD workflow was generated by Opus agent (agentId: a899772).**

See agent output above and GitHub Issue #11 for complete handler specifications including regex patterns, error messages, test cases, and priority rationale.

## Next Steps

1. Add constants (HandlerID, Priority) for all 5 handlers
2. Implement each handler following TDD
3. Test with live Claude Code session
