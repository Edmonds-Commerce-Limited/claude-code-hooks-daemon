# Plan 00466: niggles ledger sixteen

**Status**: In Progress
**Created**: 2026-09-24
**Owner**: dev
**Priority**: Medium
**Recommended Executor**: Sonnet
**Execution Strategy**: Direct

## Overview

The rolling ledger for defects found in passing. Ledger fifteen
([00422](../00422-niggles-ledger-fifteen/PLAN.md)) stays open for its own
entries: four are waiting on stated owner questions, and several are
graduated to plans still in flight. But its PLAN.md passed the 25,000-byte
warning line with N29. So new entries are filed here, and 00422 takes no
more.

Each entry gets enough evidence for someone else to reproduce it, and ends
in a terminal state: fixed, graduated to its own plan, or dismissed as
not-a-defect with the reasoning kept.

## Goals

- Record each niggle with reproducible evidence in [NIGGLES.md](NIGGLES.md).
- Resolve each entry to a terminal state.

## Non-Goals

- Becoming a feature plan. A niggle that needs design graduates to its own
  numbered plan and leaves a pointer here.

## Niggles

Full write-ups are in [NIGGLES.md](NIGGLES.md). One line each here:
