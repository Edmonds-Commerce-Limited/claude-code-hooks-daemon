# Niggles ledger sixteen: write-ups

Newest first. Each entry says how it was found, why it happens, and the
candidate remedies.

### N8 — `reference_repo_freshness` says BLOCKED on a call it allows

**Found by the coordinator.** A Read of a fresh clone under `untracked/repos/` was denied (`R-REFERENCE-REPO-NOT-VERIFIED`), as the default `block_once` posture intends. The next command that named that clone, a `mv` moving it to `untracked/work/`, RAN. Its hook context still opened with `BLOCKED [R-REFERENCE-REPO-NOT-VERIFIED]: a read of a governed reference clone...`.

`_verdict()` (`handlers/pre_tool_use/reference_repo_freshness.py:575-576`) returns `GatingResult(decision=Decision.ALLOW, context=[message])` for a repeat in `block_once` mode, and for `advise` mode at :565. `message` is the verbose DENY rendering (`self._formatter.verbose(rule)`), which starts with `BLOCKED`. An agent reading its context is therefore told a call was blocked when it ran. It either retries something that already happened, or learns that "BLOCKED" means nothing.

**Candidate remedy:** the allow paths render the advisory form of the rule (no `BLOCKED` prefix, same detail and fix line). Pin it with a test for each mode (`advise`, a `block_once` repeat): an ALLOW result's context never contains the deny headline. Then audit every other handler that returns `Decision.ALLOW` with a context built by the verbose deny formatter (`block_once` handlers especially, such as `lsp_enforcement`), and pin the class with a test that walks every handler's acceptance tests or allow paths.
the regenerated CLAUDE.md guidance block is not deterministic, so every daemon restart can commit a reorder

**Found by the coordinator** at the batch A merge. The integration worktree's daemon had just regenerated CLAUDE.md, and that result was committed. The main checkout's daemon then restarted on the same tree and auto-committed `ce31d6d8` ("Auto: hooks daemon regenerated CLAUDE.md handler guidance"). The commit changed 18 lines both ways. Every change is the same handler markers in a new order: `tool-disable-advisor`, `project-handler-load-checker`, `hook-registration-checker`, `routine-qa-sweep` and `secret-file-hygiene-checker` among them. The earlier 00462 merge restart committed `6359ad0c`, changing 83 lines both ways, with the same shape.

`ClaudeMdInjector._collect_tiers()` emits handlers in the order of `self._handlers` (`core/claude_md_injector.py:642`) and never sorts them. Two daemons on one tree can therefore produce different blocks, apparently for handlers that share a priority. The results:

- A spurious auto-commit on restart.
- A CLAUDE.md conflict whenever two branches merge. This happened twice while building batch A.
- A worktree's regenerated block that never matches main's.

**Candidate remedy:** emit in a total order that depends only on the handler set, for example tier, then priority, then handler name. Test that two injector runs over the same handlers in shuffled input order produce byte-identical blocks. Check whether `HOOKS-DAEMON.md` generation has the same tie problem, and give it the same fix.
`goal_injection` treats any edit of an In Progress plan as the plan starting

**Found by the coordinator**, live. The supervisor had set the goal to Plan
00461\. The coordinator then added a table row to this ledger's PLAN.md. That
edit drew `⚠️ GOAL DISPLACED: ... Plan(s) 00461 is now superseded by Plan 00466's goal`, and the handler wrote a goal-intent signal for 00466.

The handler's docstring says it writes the signal "when a plan flips to In
Progress". `handle()` never looks for a flip. It reads the PLAN.md from disk
after the write, and `_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS_RE` matches any plan whose
**Status** line reads In Progress. The once-per-plan-per-session latch is
the only limit. So the first Write or Edit in a session to any plan that is
already In Progress fires, however unrelated to its status. That includes a
ledger row, a task tick or a typo fix. The results:

- The supervisor receives a goal for a plan nobody started. For a rolling
  ledger that goal cannot complete.
- The displacement advisory tells the session that the goal it is really
  working was superseded.
- The ledger now tracks the edited plan as owed work, and the Stop hook
  challenges stops on its behalf.

**Candidate remedy:** fire only on a real transition. For `Edit`, the
`old_string` → `new_string` pair changes the **Status** line to In Progress.
For `Write`, the file's previous content (for example the pre-write copy
`write_clobber_guard` already reasons about, or git's `HEAD` version) did
not read In Progress, or the file is new. An edit that leaves an In
Progress status unchanged emits nothing and displaces nothing. RED tests:
an Edit that adds a table row to an In Progress plan emits no signal and no
advisory; an Edit flipping Not Started to In Progress still emits; a Write
creating a new In Progress plan still emits.

### N2 — `setup_worktree.sh` tells every agent to run the full suite through `run_all.sh`

**Found by the coordinator** when it set up an integration worktree.
`scripts/setup_worktree.sh` ends with an "Agent prompt template" whose last
line is `Run ./scripts/qa/run_all.sh before committing.`, and a "Run QA" hint
with the same command (lines 389 and 400). Step 7 also treats `run_all.sh` as
the QA entry point (line 343). Two things are wrong with that:

- `enforce_llm_qa` denies `run_all.sh`; `./scripts/qa/llm_qa.py all` is the
  only full-QA entry. An agent that follows the template is denied at once.
- Plan 00463 makes full QA a coordinator gate. A sub-agent runs targeted QA
  only, and the coordinator runs one full pass over the batch of merged
  branches. The template sends every sub-agent to run the full suite, which
  is the concurrent full QA that 00463 exists to stop.

**Candidate remedy:** the template names targeted QA (`llm_qa.py <tools>`
plus the touched tests) and says that full QA is the coordinator's
integration gate. The "Run QA" hint and Step 7 name `llm_qa.py`. A test
checks that the script names no denied QA entry point.

**Graduated to Plan 00463**, which owns the sub-agent QA policy.

### N1 — `resolve_venv_python`'s fallback accepts a venv interpreter that cannot run on this host

**Found by Plan 00457's agent** (#55; recorded in 00457's JOURNAL as a
finding). When the slug-exact venv is absent, `resolve_venv_python` falls
back to globbing `untracked/venv-*/bin/python`, and accepts a candidate on
its executable bit alone. #55 is about a host whose only venv was built
inside a container. That interpreter may be for another architecture or
libc, or may symlink into a path that exists only in the container. It is
executable but cannot run. The fallback would then report "resolved", so
`bin/hooks-daemon` never reaches `_run_venv_free_verb` (the `repair` and
`signal` arms from Plans 00456 and 00457). It would fail when it runs the
interpreter, not with the clear venv-missing path. No test covers it on
either side of #53 or #55.

**Candidate remedies:**

1. The fallback proves a candidate RUNS, e.g.
   `"$candidate" -c 'import sys'` with a short bound, before accepting it.
   It moves on to the next candidate, then to the venv-free path, on
   failure. Test it with a fake executable that exits non-zero, and with a
   dangling symlink.
2. At minimum, a candidate that fails at exec time produces a message
   naming the venv it tried and the `repair` command, not a raw exec error.
