### N1 — `resolve_venv_python`'s fallback accepts a venv interpreter that cannot run on this host

**Found by Plan 00457's agent** (#55; recorded in 00457's JOURNAL as a
finding). When the slug-exact venv is absent, `resolve_venv_python` falls
back to globbing `untracked/venv-*/bin/python`, and accepts a candidate on
its executable bit alone. #55 is about a host whose only venv was built
inside a container. That interpreter may be for another architecture or
libc, or may symlink into a path that exists only in the container. It is
executable but cannot run. The fallback would then report "resolved", so
`bin/hooks-daemon` never reaches `_run_venv_free_verb` (the `repair` and
`signal` arms from Plans 00456 and 00457). It would fail when it runs the
interpreter, not with the clear venv-missing path. No test covers it on
either side of #53 or #55.

**Candidate remedies:**

1. The fallback proves a candidate RUNS, e.g.
   `"$candidate" -c 'import sys'` with a short bound, before accepting it.
   It moves on to the next candidate, then to the venv-free path, on
   failure. Test it with a fake executable that exits non-zero, and with a
   dangling symlink.
2. At minimum, a candidate that fails at exec time produces a message
   naming the venv it tried and the `repair` command, not a raw exec error.
