# Niggles ledger sixteen: write-ups

Newest first. Each entry says how it was found, why it happens, and the
candidate remedies.

### N22 — `lsp_enforcement` takes another command's argument for a grep symbol lookup

**Found by the coordinator**, live. The command was `python scripts/qa/llm_qa.py format lint ... plan_qa docs_qa ... > out.txt; grep -E '^(✅|❌)|^QA:' out.txt`. It was denied with `BLOCKED [R-LSP-SYMBOL-LOOKUP]: ... pattern 'plan_qa' looks like a symbol search`. `plan_qa` is a positional argument to `llm_qa.py`, not to `grep`. The grep's real pattern, `^(✅|❌)|^QA:`, is not symbol-shaped at all. The handler found a `grep` somewhere in the command and then took a symbol-like word from elsewhere in it. `block_once` let the identical retry through, so the cost was one wasted turn. But every "run a QA tool, then grep its capture" command is the everyday shape here, and each one is a coin toss on which word gets picked.

**Candidate remedy:** tokenise the command into its separate simple commands (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`), and judge only the pattern argument of a `grep`/`rg` command, never a word belonging to a different command. RED test: the command above is allowed, and `python x.py foo; grep -rn 'def my_function' src/` is still caught on `my_function`. Once 00463/00464 land, this belongs on the shared shell lexer that the parser consolidation (coordinator queue) produces.

### N21 — the semgrep QA gate passes when a rule times out

**Found by the 00414/00415 agent.** Its first version of a new semgrep rule timed out on `daemon/cli.py`, and `scripts/qa/run_semgrep_check.sh` reported PASS. A rule that times out has checked nothing for that file, so the gate fails OPEN, and the slower and more complex a rule is, the more likely it is to be silently skipped on exactly the large files it exists for.

**Candidate remedy:** a timeout, or any semgrep error entry in its JSON output (`errors[]`), fails the gate and names the rule and file. RED test: a rule forced to time out on a fixture makes the gate exit non-zero with the rule named. Check the other QA wrappers for the same "tool error reads as clean" shape, and pin the class.

### N20 — ✅ Remedied — the capture-corruption auditor judges a multi-line single-quoted string one line at a time

**Found by the B1 integration agent**, as the stated limit of its fix for the auditor's backslash-continuation false positive. `scripts/qa/audit_capture_corruption.py` now joins `\`-continued lines, but a single-quoted string that spans physical lines (`echo 'x` followed by `y' >&2`) is still judged per line. So the redirect on the second line is not seen, and the echo is flagged. Nothing in the repository has that shape today, so it is latent. The same false positive that broke B1's gate would come back the first time someone writes one.

**Candidate remedy:** carry the open-quote state across physical lines for single-quoted strings too, joining the logical line the same way continuations are joined. RED test: the two-line single-quoted echo with the redirect on the second line is not flagged, and one without the redirect is.

**Remedy:** the auditor now reads each file through one tokeniser (`_logical_lines`), not a heredoc regex plus a per-line continuation join. The tokeniser tracks a stack of single, double and `$'` quotes, `$(...)`, backticks and arithmetic across physical lines. A command stays open while a quote or substitution is open, or while a line ends in a backslash. Each command is joined onto the line it starts on, and the lines it swallows are blanked, so findings keep their physical line numbers. Double-quoted strings, backticks and `$(` captures are covered too. A capture that names its function on the line after `$(` is now seen.

Checking the rest of the file for the same one-line-at-a-time assumption found three more defects in heredoc detection, fixed in the same change:

- **A heredoc operator was recognised anywhere on a line**, including inside quotes and comments. `scripts/upgrade.sh:949` (`printf '\n<<<UPGRADE_METADATA\n'`) made the auditor skip the last 12 non-empty lines of that file. That was a latent false negative: code nobody was auditing.
- **`<<"EOF"` and `<<\EOF` were not recognised**, so their bodies were audited as code.
- **Here-strings (`<<<`) and arithmetic shifts** could both be misread as heredocs.

A heredoc operator now counts only in code. A heredoc body starts after the first newline that is real shell syntax.

Because quote state now decides which lines are judged, a file whose quote, substitution or heredoc never closes is reported as `unparseable-shell`. Before, it was silently audited as one run-on line. Inside a `$(...)` it also tracks `case ... esac`, so a pattern's `)` never closes the substitution. That covers a pattern's optional leading `(`, extglob parens, `;;`, `;&` and `;;&`, a last clause without `;;`, and a `case` nested in a substitution inside a clause. `case` counts as a reserved word only where a command can start.

On all 65 scanned scripts, the new tokeniser extracts the same 227 functions and the same captured names as before, and reports no unclosed spans. Report: [subagent-reports/260924-n466-n20-opus-5-5.md](subagent-reports/260924-n466-n20-opus-5-5.md).

N16 is filed on the unmerged `worktree-n466-guard-defects` branch; it joins this file at integration.

### N19 — the registry's options-collection failure is logged at debug level

**Found by the N13/N14 agent.** The handler registry's pass-1 `except Exception` logs a failure to collect a handler's options at debug level only. During the N14 work, a local variable that shadowed the new accessor made the registry silently drop EVERY handler's options, and only an existing registry test caught it before commit. In production, that failure would have looked like every handler running on defaults, with nothing at a visible log level.

**Candidate remedy:** narrow the catch to the exceptions that option collection can legitimately raise, and log anything else at error level with the handler name. If a handler's configured options cannot be applied, that is a degraded protection state and should surface in `health`. RED test: an injected failure while collecting options is visible at error level and in health.

### N18 — PlanWorkflow.core.md says the plan index is linted against one rule

**Found by the N13/N14 agent.** `CLAUDE/core/PlanWorkflow.core.md:407` and its deployed template copy say the plan index is linted "against one rule". `index-no-log` already made that false, and N13 adds `plan-stats-arithmetic` to the commit gate. The page is a deployed template pair, so it ships to clients.

**Candidate remedy:** name the rules, or better, point at the plan QA rule list, which is the source of truth, instead of counting. Change both copies of the pair together, and pin it with a doc-truth test that the page names no count that disagrees with the registry.

### N17 — `skill_opportunity_detector` never receives its configured options

**Found by the N13/N14 agent.** `_options()` reads `self.config["options"]`, which only `configure()` populates. Nothing in `src/` calls `configure()`; the registry injects options as `_<key>` attributes instead. So a configured `check_interval_days` is ignored at runtime, and only the unit tests, which call `configure()` directly, exercise the option.

**Candidate remedy:** read options the way the registry delivers them, through the shared accessor. RED test: a handler built by the real registry from a config with a non-default `check_interval_days` uses it. Then audit every handler for a `configure()`-only options path, and pin the class with a test that instantiates each handler through the registry with a non-default value for every declared option and checks that it is honoured.

### N15 — `remote-docs add` scans a capture with an unconfigured `sensitive_content` handler

**Found by the Plan 00468 docs agent.** `daemon/cli.py` (~:6377) builds `SensitiveContentHandler()` with none of its configured options for the capture-time `scan_text` in `remote-docs add`. So the scan at the moment a page is vendored runs with no public patterns at all. That is how 28 example UUIDs were vendored into `hooks.md` without a warning, to be caught only later by the tree-wide QA scan. The secret word list happens to be found only because the configured path equals the default. This is the same class as N14: a component reads a handler's behaviour without that handler's configured options.

**Candidate remedy:** construct the handler from the project's resolved config, through the same shared handler-options accessor N14 introduces. RED test: `remote-docs add` of a page carrying a configured public-pattern match reports it at capture time, and a non-default `secret_word_list_path` is honoured. Add the construct-without-config shape to N14's class audit.

### N14 — log and payload redaction ignore a configured secret word list path

**Found by the 00414/00415 agent**, outside its brief. `utils/secret_redaction.py` `_resolve_active_path` reads `handler_cfg.get("options", {})` only when `isinstance(handler_cfg, dict)`. But `Config` coerces every handler entry to a `HandlerConfig` model (`type(c.handlers.pre_tool_use.get("sensitive_content"))` is `HandlerConfig`), so the isinstance test is never true. The daemon-wide resolver therefore never reads a configured `secret_word_list_path`, and always falls back to the default `.claude/block-words.secret`. The `sensitive_content` handler reads its own option correctly, so blocking still works. But payload capture and log redaction silently use the wrong list, or no list, in any project whose word list lives somewhere else. That is exactly how a secret term reaches a log. This repository is unaffected only because its configured path equals the default. `secret_file_matching.resolve_configured_patterns` carries a comment about this same mistake and fixed its own copy, so this is the second sighting of the class.

**Candidate remedy:** read the option through `HandlerConfig.options`, via one shared accessor for handler options that accepts either shape. RED test: with a non-default `secret_word_list_path`, a term from that list is redacted from a captured payload and a log line. Then audit every `isinstance(<handler config>, dict)` read of handler config across `src/`, and pin the class with a test or QA check that fails when handler config is read as a dict.

### N13 — the plan-index statistics arithmetic is checked only by full QA, so a wrong count reaches main

**Found by the coordinator**, through Plan 00421's agent. Opening Plan 00468 updated the README statistics bullets (468 allocated, 455 distinct) but missed the closing self-check line (`454 + 13 = 467`). `check_repo_hygiene.py`'s `plan-stats-arithmetic` check catches exactly this. But it runs only in `llm_qa.py all`, and the commit-time plan QA gate that runs on every README commit does not include it. The inconsistent index was therefore committed and pushed (d10bbf13), and was found only when an agent ran the hygiene checker by hand. The same README gate already enforces row length and the 30-row completed window at commit time.

**Candidate remedy:** run the `plan-stats-arithmetic` check in the commit-time plan QA gate whenever the staged tree touches the plan index, or move the check into plan QA and have repo_hygiene call it. Either way there is one implementation. RED test: a commit staging a README whose statistics disagree with the self-check line is denied, and names the line to fix.

### N12 — a hand-built probe payload is logged as real traffic, because nothing tells a prober to mark it

**Found by the Plan 00467 plugin audit.** The audit fed synthetic PreToolUse payloads through `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use` to probe handler verdicts. They carried no `synthetic_source` field, and their session ids (`plugin-audit-probe` and similar) match no known synthetic shape. So `daemon/synthetic_traffic.py` classed them as REAL traffic in `verdicts.jsonl`, including the orchestrator-simulate record that Plan 00418's enforcement decision will be read from. The marker (`SYNTHETIC_SOURCE_FIELD`, `synthetic_traffic.py:39`) is documented only in that module's docstring. CLAUDE/DEBUGGING_HOOKS.md, the handler-development guide and the agent-facing docs never mention it, so a prober cannot know to set it.

**Candidate remedy:** document the marker wherever probing a handler is taught (DEBUGGING_HOOKS.md, HANDLER_DEVELOPMENT.md, and the acceptance and playbook guidance), with a copy-paste payload that sets it. Consider a small `bin/hooks-daemon probe <event> <json>` helper that sets the marker itself. Add a test that the probing docs name the field.

### N11 — any exception in `secret_file_guard.matches()` lets the call through unless `strict_mode` is on

**Found by the 00466 review** (major M4, `subagent-reports/260924-n466-review-opus-5-5.md`). N5's crash was the second time an exception in this guard's `matches()` skipped the guard entirely; Plan 00357 was the first. Under the default `strict_mode: false` the chain logs the exception and allows the call. This repository runs `strict_mode: true`, so here the crash denied, but a client on the defaults fails open. One raise path is still live after N5, though it isn't exploitable: a file path containing a NUL byte.

**Candidate remedy:** make the guard structurally fail closed. A raise anywhere in its match or route computation becomes a deny naming the internal error, whatever the global `strict_mode`, because a protected-read guard that fails open is worse than a false deny. Pin it with a test that injects an exception at each stage. Then audit the other security guards that should behave the same (`sensitive_content`, `project_containment`, the destructive-git rules) and decide each one explicitly.

### N10 — a wildcard in the middle of a protected filename gets past `secret_file_guard`

**Found by the 00466 review** as a pre-existing problem on main, security-relevant. `cat .vault-pas?word` and `cat prod.vault-passw*rd` name a protected file through a glob the shell expands, and the guard does not deny them. The mention scan handles a leading or trailing wildcard (the N4 overlap logic), but not a `?`, `*` or `[...]` inside the name.

**Candidate remedy:** treat any shell-glob token as a pattern, and deny when the pattern could match a protected name. Compare against the protected basenames and stems, or expand it against the directory when that exists. Keep it no looser than the N4 rule. RED tests: interior `?`, `*` and bracket globs of each shipped protected pattern are denied, while unrelated globs such as `*.py` and `src/*.md` are allowed.

### N9 — `docs_qa` judges gitignored markdown, so installing a Claude Code plugin fails local full QA

**Found by the coordinator** right after installing the Defence Before Fix plugin at project scope (Plan 00467). In this container Claude Code's config directory is `.claude/ccy/`, so the plugin's cache (`.claude/ccy/plugins/cache/...`) and marketplace clone (`.claude/ccy/plugins/marketplaces/...`) land inside the repository. Both are gitignored (`.claude/ccy/.gitignore:3: *`). `llm_qa.py docs_qa` then reported 12 `source-tree-markdown` findings, one per vendored spec file, and the tool FAILED. It reported 0 findings at batch A's gate, before the install. CI does not see this, because a fresh checkout has no `.claude/ccy/`. Every local full QA run, including the coordinator's integration gate, now fails on files that are not part of the project.

The docs corpus walks the filesystem without honouring `.gitignore` (`docs_qa/corpus.py`; it already special-cases `.claude/ccy/CLAUDE.md`, lines 149 and 421).

**Candidate remedy:** the corpus considers only tracked files plus untracked files that are NOT ignored, i.e. `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`, with a defined fallback outside a git repository. Keep any deliberate inclusion that is ignored but meant to be scanned explicit and named. RED test: a gitignored markdown file under a source-like directory produces no finding, and a tracked one still does. Audit the other QA corpora (plan_qa, doc_snippets, doc_truth, repo_hygiene, sensitive_content, british_english) for the same filesystem-walk assumption, and pin the class.

### N8 — ✅ Remedied — `reference_repo_freshness` says BLOCKED on a call it allows

**Found by the coordinator.** A Read of a fresh clone under `untracked/repos/` was denied (`R-REFERENCE-REPO-NOT-VERIFIED`), as the default `block_once` posture intends. The next command that named that clone, a `mv` moving it to `untracked/work/`, RAN. Its hook context still opened with `BLOCKED [R-REFERENCE-REPO-NOT-VERIFIED]: a read of a governed reference clone...`.

`_verdict()` (`handlers/pre_tool_use/reference_repo_freshness.py:575-576`) returns `GatingResult(decision=Decision.ALLOW, context=[message])` for a repeat in `block_once` mode, and for `advise` mode at :565. `message` is the verbose DENY rendering (`self._formatter.verbose(rule)`), which starts with `BLOCKED`. An agent reading its context is therefore told a call was blocked when it ran. It either retries something that already happened, or learns that "BLOCKED" means nothing.

**Remedy:** `RuleFormatter` gained a fourth rendering, `advisory(rule)` (`core/rule.py`) — same `rule_id` and the same `Rule.verbose` teaching content as `verbose()`, headed `ADVISORY` instead of `BLOCKED`, matching the "ADVISORY:" convention several handlers already use for their own hand-rolled non-blocking reports (no new format was invented). `reference_repo_freshness.handle()` now computes `_is_blocking(session_id, subject, mode)` — a preview of `_verdict()`'s own decision, pinned to it by `TestIsBlockingMatchesVerdict` — BEFORE building the message, and `_not_verified`/`_stale` select `verbose()` when the call will actually be denied and `advisory()` when it will not (an `advise`-mode result or a `block_once` repeat). `_verdict()` itself is unchanged; it stays the sole place that decides and records.

An AST-based static sweep of every handler for `Decision.ALLOW` built from `formatter.verbose`/`terse` content (directly or through an assignment chain) found exactly one other confirmed occurrence: `reference_repo_freshness` itself — the fix above. Two structurally similar but SAFE call sites surfaced for manual review (`lint_on_edit._run_lint_command`'s `language_name` parameter, `plan_qa_edit._advisory_result`'s `findings` parameter) and were confirmed not to carry deny-shaped content. `lsp_enforcement`, named by name as a suspect, was confirmed already correct: its `block_once` repeat and `advisory` mode both return a plain `dynamic_detail` string with no rule-id/BLOCKED prefix.

The class-wide guard lives at `tests/integration/test_allow_never_carries_deny_headline.py`: it drives every handler's own declared BLOCKING acceptance test twice against the SAME instance, replicating the history-recording step `DaemonController.dispatch()` performs after every route (`daemon/controller.py`) so a handler whose block-once state lives in the shared `HandlerHistory` data layer (not an in-instance dict, e.g. `lsp_enforcement`) genuinely sees its repeat call transition to ALLOW — and asserts the repeat's `reason`/`context` never contains the `"BLOCKED ["` signature. Confirmed RED against a deliberately reintroduced defect in `lsp_enforcement` (caught it), then GREEN once reverted. `reference_repo_freshness`'s own regression coverage lives in its unit tests (`TestBlockOnce`, `TestConfiguredModes`, `TestNotVerified`) instead, RED/GREEN-verified the same way — its only DENY acceptance test declares `harness_cannot_produce` (no fixture can build a real governed checkout), so the integration harness cannot reach it.

### N7 — the regenerated CLAUDE.md guidance block is not deterministic, so every daemon restart can commit a reorder

**Found by the coordinator** at the batch A merge. The integration worktree's daemon had just regenerated CLAUDE.md, and that result was committed. The main checkout's daemon then restarted on the same tree and auto-committed `ce31d6d8` ("Auto: hooks daemon regenerated CLAUDE.md handler guidance"). The commit changed 18 lines both ways. Every change is the same handler markers in a new order: `tool-disable-advisor`, `project-handler-load-checker`, `hook-registration-checker`, `routine-qa-sweep` and `secret-file-hygiene-checker` among them. The earlier 00462 merge restart committed `6359ad0c`, changing 83 lines both ways, with the same shape.

`ClaudeMdInjector._collect_tiers()` emits handlers in the order of `self._handlers` (`core/claude_md_injector.py:642`) and never sorts them. Two daemons on one tree can therefore produce different blocks, apparently for handlers that share a priority. The results:

- A spurious auto-commit on restart.
- A CLAUDE.md conflict whenever two branches merge. This happened twice while building batch A.
- A worktree's regenerated block that never matches main's.

**Candidate remedy:** emit in a total order that depends only on the handler set, for example tier, then priority, then handler name. Test that two injector runs over the same handlers in shuffled input order produce byte-identical blocks. Check whether `HOOKS-DAEMON.md` generation has the same tie problem, and give it the same fix.

### N3 — `goal_injection` treats any edit of an In Progress plan as the plan starting

**Found by the coordinator**, live. The supervisor had set the goal to Plan
00461\. The coordinator then added a table row to this ledger's PLAN.md. That
edit drew `⚠️ GOAL DISPLACED: ... Plan(s) 00461 is now superseded by Plan 00466's goal`, and the handler wrote a goal-intent signal for 00466.

The handler's docstring says it writes the signal "when a plan flips to In
Progress". `handle()` never looks for a flip. It reads the PLAN.md from disk
after the write, and `_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS_RE` matches any plan whose
**Status** line reads In Progress. The once-per-plan-per-session latch is
the only limit. So the first Write or Edit in a session to any plan that is
already In Progress fires, however unrelated to its status. That includes a
ledger row, a task tick or a typo fix. The results:

- The supervisor receives a goal for a plan nobody started. For a rolling
  ledger that goal cannot complete.
- The displacement advisory tells the session that the goal it is really
  working was superseded.
- The ledger now tracks the edited plan as owed work, and the Stop hook
  challenges stops on its behalf.

**Candidate remedy:** fire only on a real transition. For `Edit`, the
`old_string` → `new_string` pair changes the **Status** line to In Progress.
For `Write`, the file's previous content (for example the pre-write copy
`write_clobber_guard` already reasons about, or git's `HEAD` version) did
not read In Progress, or the file is new. An edit that leaves an In
Progress status unchanged emits nothing and displaces nothing. RED tests:
an Edit that adds a table row to an In Progress plan emits no signal and no
advisory; an Edit flipping Not Started to In Progress still emits; a Write
creating a new In Progress plan still emits.

### N2 — `setup_worktree.sh` tells every agent to run the full suite through `run_all.sh`

**Found by the coordinator** when it set up an integration worktree.
`scripts/setup_worktree.sh` ends with an "Agent prompt template" whose last
line is `Run ./scripts/qa/run_all.sh before committing.`, and a "Run QA" hint
with the same command (lines 389 and 400). Step 7 also treats `run_all.sh` as
the QA entry point (line 343). Two things are wrong with that:

- `enforce_llm_qa` denies `run_all.sh`; `./scripts/qa/llm_qa.py all` is the
  only full-QA entry. An agent that follows the template is denied at once.
- Plan 00463 makes full QA a coordinator gate. A sub-agent runs targeted QA
  only, and the coordinator runs one full pass over the batch of merged
  branches. The template sends every sub-agent to run the full suite, which
  is the concurrent full QA that 00463 exists to stop.

**Candidate remedy:** the template names targeted QA (`llm_qa.py <tools>`
plus the touched tests) and says that full QA is the coordinator's
integration gate. The "Run QA" hint and Step 7 name `llm_qa.py`. A test
checks that the script names no denied QA entry point.

**Graduated to Plan 00463**, which owns the sub-agent QA policy.

### N1 — ✅ Remedied — `resolve_venv_python`'s fallback accepts a venv interpreter that cannot run on this host

**Found by Plan 00457's agent** (#55; recorded in 00457's JOURNAL as a
finding). When the slug-exact venv is absent, `resolve_venv_python` falls
back to globbing `untracked/venv-*/bin/python`, and accepts a candidate on
its executable bit alone. #55 is about a host whose only venv was built
inside a container. That interpreter may be for another architecture or
libc, or may symlink into a path that exists only in the container. It is
executable but cannot run. The fallback would then report "resolved", so
`bin/hooks-daemon` never reaches `_run_venv_free_verb` (the `repair` and
`signal` arms from Plans 00456 and 00457). It would fail when it runs the
interpreter, not with the clear venv-missing path. No test covers it on
either side of #53 or #55.

**Candidate remedies:**

1. The fallback proves a candidate RUNS, e.g.
   `"$candidate" -c 'import sys'` with a short bound, before accepting it.
   It moves on to the next candidate, then to the venv-free path, on
   failure. Test it with a fake executable that exits non-zero, and with a
   dangling symlink.
2. At minimum, a candidate that fails at exec time produces a message
   naming the venv it tried and the `repair` command, not a raw exec error.

**Remedy** (remedy 1, plus remedy 2's diagnostic): every implementation
that trusted a venv interpreter's executable bit alone now proves it RUNS
first.

- Bash: `scripts/lib/resolve_venv.sh::_rv_pick_python`'s two glob loops
  (`venv-*/bin/python`, `venv-*/bin/python3`) probe each candidate with a
  new `_rv_candidate_runs` helper (`"$candidate" -c 'import sys'`) before
  accepting it, falling through to the next candidate — and eventually to
  `bin/hooks-daemon`'s venv-free path — on failure. The bound is enforced
  by a watchdog subprocess (`( sleep N; kill -KILL "$pid" )  &` + a
  blocking `wait "$pid"`), not a `sleep`-poll loop: a poll loop always
  costs at least one full poll interval even for a candidate that exits
  in milliseconds, because the first check almost always lands before the
  process has exited. Measured on this repo's own real venv `bin/python`:
  ~1005ms/candidate under an earlier `sleep 1`-poll draft, ~15-40ms/candidate
  under the watchdog. `HOOKS_DAEMON_VENV_PROBE_TIMEOUT` overrides the
  5-second default bound (mirrors `Timeout.VALIDATION_CHECK`). Both glob
  loops now report which candidate they rejected and why on stderr before
  moving on, closing remedy 2 for the bash side.
- Python: `resolve_existing_venv_python_with_diagnostics`'s shared
  `_pick_interpreter` closure (used by steps 3, 4 and 5) and step 2's
  metadata `python_path` check now all route through a new
  `_venv_interpreter_runs` helper before accepting a candidate — the SAME
  `-c 'import sys'` probe, via `subprocess.run(..., timeout=5)`. Steps 3
  and 5 (single-candidate) and step 4 (scan) each report which candidate(s)
  were executable-but-unrunnable and name the `repair` command, closing
  remedy 2 there too. The "slug-exact" fingerprint-keyed venv (step 3) is
  probed too, not exempted — #55 already showed an exact-fingerprint match
  can be container-built and still unrunnable (e.g. a shared/NFS-mounted
  `untracked/`), and this resolver only runs on a bash-side resolver-cache
  MISS, so the extra spawn never lands on the per-hook hot path.
- `resolve_existing_venv_python` (the simpler, no-diagnostics function)
  deliberately stays un-probed: it is called fresh on every user turn by
  `daemon_upgrade_detector`, which only reads `.daemon-metadata.json` next
  to the returned path and never executes it, so probing there would add
  a real hot-path cost for no correctness gain.
  `client_validator.py::validate_daemon_can_start` — the other caller,
  which DOES execute the result — already ran its own
  `subprocess.run(..., timeout=Timeout.VALIDATION_CHECK)` probe before
  doing so, so it needed no change. Both are recorded in the sibling audit
  in the delivery report.
- `check_canonical_callers.sh` was already the sibling-audit backstop for
  the bash side: it denies any OTHER shell script that iterates
  `untracked/venv-*` directly, so `_rv_pick_python` is the only bash glob
  site that needed the fix.

TDD: RED tests confirmed failing against the pre-fix code first, in both
`tests/unit/daemon/test_paths_resolve_venv_diagnostics.py::TestRunnabilityProbe`
and the new `tests/integration/test_resolve_venv_runnability_probe.py`,
covering a fake executable that exits non-zero, a dangling symlink, a
hanging candidate (bound respected), fall-through to a good second
candidate, all-candidates-bad reaching the venv-free path, and the
slug-exact venv unaffected when it genuinely works.

**Follow-up defect, fixed at integration (766677c1).** The B1 full gate
failed `tests/acceptance/test_v391_field_regression.py`. That test runs the
resolver with a PATH holding only a broken `python3`. The watchdog ran
`sleep` from PATH, so with no `sleep` it went straight to `kill -KILL`. A
working venv was then rejected as "timed out after 5s", which is the v3.9.1
field case this resolver exists to survive. The branch's targeted QA had
not run that acceptance test. `_rv_wait_secs` now uses `sleep` when PATH
has one. Otherwise it waits on `read -t` against a read-write
process-substitution pipe, which needs no PATH lookup, and the kill runs
only if the full bound elapsed. Two regression tests cover a PATH with no
`sleep`: a good candidate still resolves, and a hanging one is still
bounded.

**✅ Remedied** on main (B1, 2e6483a3).
