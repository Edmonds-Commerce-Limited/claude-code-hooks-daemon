# Plan 00057: Single Daemon Process Enforcement

**Status**: In Progress
**Created**: 2026-02-13
**Started**: 2026-02-13
**Owner**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Priority**: Medium
**Recommended Executor**: Sonnet
**Execution Strategy**: Sub-Agent Orchestration

## Overview

Implement a robust single daemon process enforcement system that prevents multiple daemon instances from running simultaneously in the entire process tree. This is particularly valuable in container environments where it's safe to aggressively ensure only one daemon process exists system-wide.

**Key Insight**: In containers, we can assume the container is dedicated to our project, so we enforce a single `claude_code_hooks_daemon` process across the ENTIRE system (not per-project).

The system will include:
- Container detection during install/upgrade
- Configurable single-process enforcement
- Simple process name matching (no project path verification needed in containers)
- Aggressive cleanup of ALL daemon processes in containers

## Goals

- Add `enforce_single_daemon_process` config option to DaemonConfig
- Implement simple daemon process detection by name (system-wide)
- Create container detection utility for install/upgrade phase
- Auto-enable enforcement in container environments
- In containers: Kill ALL `claude_code_hooks_daemon` processes except the one starting
- Outside containers: Only clean up stale PID files (conservative)
- Maintain backward compatibility (feature is opt-in by default)

## Non-Goals

- Not implementing cross-machine daemon coordination (only local process management)
- Not implementing daemon clustering or load balancing
- Not changing existing daemon lifecycle for non-enforced mode

## Execution Strategy

**Recommended approach**: Sub-Agent Orchestration (Sonnet main thread)

### Phase-Level Parallelization

**Independent phases** that can be executed in parallel:
- Phase 2 (Container Detection) - python-developer agent
- Phase 3 (Process Verification) - python-developer agent

**Sequential phases** that must complete before others:
1. Phase 1 (Design & Config) - main thread (architectural decisions)
2. Phase 2 & 3 in parallel - delegated to sub-agents
3. Phase 4 (Enforcement Logic) - main thread (integrates Phase 2 & 3)
4. Phase 5 (Install Integration) - python-developer agent
5. Phase 6 (Integration Testing) - qa-runner agent
6. Phase 7 (Documentation) - main thread
7. Phase 8 (Acceptance Testing) - main thread (real tool calls required)

### Sub-Agent Delegation

**Parallel execution** (after Phase 1):
```
Main (Sonnet) spawns:
├─ Agent A: Phase 2 (Container Detection utility + tests)
└─ Agent B: Phase 3 (Process Verification logic + tests)

Main waits for both, then proceeds to Phase 4
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces total execution time (~40% faster with parallelization)
- Agents work independently on isolated modules
- Main thread focuses on coordination and integration

## Context & Background

### Current State

The daemon start process (`cmd_start()` in `cli.py`) currently:
1. Reads PID file via `read_pid_file()`
2. If PID exists, assumes daemon is running and exits
3. No verification that process is actually running
4. No verification that it's actually our daemon (PID could be reused)

**Problems**:
- Stale PID files cause false "already running" messages
- Multiple daemon processes could exist if PID files are in different locations
- No protection against accidental multiple starts

### Container Safety - System-Wide Enforcement

In containerized environments (Docker, Podman):
- Container is dedicated to our project (single workspace)
- Safe to enforce single daemon process **across entire system**
- Root access available for process management
- No risk of killing daemons from other projects (no other projects exist)
- **Simplified approach**: Just search for `claude_code_hooks_daemon` in process list

**Key simplification**: In containers, we don't need to verify project paths. We can just ensure there's only ONE `claude_code_hooks_daemon` process running anywhere in the system.

Existing container detection: `handlers/session_start/yolo_container_detection.py` has robust multi-indicator detection system.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Process Verification Strategy (UPDATED)
**Context**: Need to find all daemon processes to enforce single-instance constraint.

**Original Options Considered**:
1. Check PID only (current behavior) - Fast but unreliable
2. Check PID + process name - Simple, works for containers
3. Check PID + process name + command-line args - More complex, not needed
4. Check PID + socket connection test - Too expensive

**Decision**: Use option 2 (PID + process name matching) - **SIMPLIFIED**
- In containers: Search for ANY process with `claude_code_hooks_daemon` in name/cmdline
- No need to verify project paths (container is dedicated to our project)
- Use `psutil` for cross-platform process enumeration
- Fast enumeration (<10ms for typical process list)
- Container-safe: Only one project exists, so all daemons are ours

**Why simplified?** User clarification: In containers, enforce single daemon **system-wide** (not per-project). This eliminates need for project path verification.

### Decision 2: Cleanup Strategy (UPDATED)
**Context**: When should we kill existing daemon processes?

**Options Considered**:
1. Always kill all daemons - Too aggressive outside containers
2. Never kill, just warn - Too passive, doesn't solve the problem
3. Kill only if in container - Safe and effective
4. Kill if config enabled AND (in container OR stale PID) - Balanced approach

**Decision**: Use option 3/4 hybrid (container-aware aggressive cleanup) - **SIMPLIFIED**
- **In containers + enforcement enabled**: Kill ALL `claude_code_hooks_daemon` processes system-wide
- **Outside containers + enforcement enabled**: Only clean up stale PID for current project
- Always requires `enforce_single_daemon_process: true` in config
- Log all cleanup actions for debugging
- System-wide enforcement in containers (no project path checks)

**Why this approach?**
- Containers are single-project environments
- Safe to kill ALL daemon processes in container (no other projects)
- Outside containers, be conservative (could be multiple projects)

**Date**: 2026-02-13 (Updated)

### Decision 3: Container Detection Threshold
**Context**: When to auto-enable enforcement during install?

**Options Considered**:
1. Enable if ANY container indicator present - Too aggressive
2. Enable if confidence score >= 3 (same as YOLO handler) - Balanced
3. Enable only for CLAUDECODE=1 - Too conservative
4. Never auto-enable, require manual config - Too passive

**Decision**: Use option 2 (confidence score >= 3)
- Reuses proven detection logic from `yolo_container_detection.py`
- Low false positive rate (requires multiple indicators)
- User can override by commenting out config option
- Provides safety where it matters most (containers)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Kill wrong process (PID reuse) | High | Low | Use command-line verification, not just PID |
| False positive in non-container | Medium | Low | Conservative container detection (score >= 3) |
| Process verification too slow | Low | Medium | Use lightweight checks (psutil or /proc) |
| Cross-platform compatibility | Medium | Medium | Test on Linux and macOS, use psutil for portability |
| Stale PID file not detected | Medium | Low | Verify process is running, not just PID file exists |
