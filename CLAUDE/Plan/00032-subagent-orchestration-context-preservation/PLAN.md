# Plan 00032: Sub-Agent Orchestration for Context Preservation

**Status**: Not Started
**Created**: 2026-02-06
**Owner**: Main Claude (Orchestrator)
**Priority**: High

## Overview

Implement comprehensive sub-agent orchestration to preserve main thread context. Main Claude should orchestrate work through specialized sub-agents rather than executing tasks directly, preventing context pollution and enabling effectively infinite conversations through strategic delegation.

**Key Constraint**: Agents CANNOT spawn nested agents (per release-agent.md). Only the main Claude thread can spawn agents. This means orchestration must be centralized in main thread.

## Goals

1. **Create specialized sub-agents** for all workflow gates and orchestration tasks
2. **Enforce sub-agent usage** via PreToolUse handlers (prevent direct tool execution)
3. **Preserve main thread context** by delegating all heavy work to sub-agents
4. **Enable agent teams** to use sub-agents for their own workflow steps
5. **Document orchestration patterns** for future work

## Non-Goals

- Nested agent spawning (impossible - only main thread can spawn)
- Auto-compaction triggering from hooks (researched - not possible)
- Changing existing agent team workflows (preserve what works)

## Context & Background

**Research findings**:
1. Manual compaction via `/compact` is the only trigger mechanism
2. PreCompact hook can observe but NOT trigger compaction
3. Agents cannot spawn nested agents (architectural constraint)
4. Main thread must orchestrate all agent spawning

**Current state**:
- 5 custom agents exist (.claude/agents/)
- Agent teams work but no sub-agent usage by teammates
- Main thread often executes QA, setup, and other tasks directly
- Context accumulates rapidly during complex work

**Why this matters**:
- Complex plans consume 30-50% of context window
- QA output pollutes context with logs
- Worktree/venv setup is verbose
- Agent teams could delegate internal work but don't

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Advisory vs Blocking Handlers

**Context**: Should handlers BLOCK direct tool execution or ADVISE?

**Options Considered**:
1. **Blocking (terminal=true)** - Force sub-agent usage, deny direct execution
2. **Advisory (terminal=false)** - Suggest sub-agent, allow override

**Decision**: Advisory (Option 2)

**Rationale**:
- Main Claude may need direct execution for debugging
- Allows gradual adoption
- Less disruptive to existing workflows
- Context awareness comes through practice, not force

**Date**: 2026-02-06

### Decision 2: Agent Model Selection

**Context**: Which model for each agent type?

**Decision**:
- **Worktree/Setup/Git agents**: haiku (fast, cheap, simple tasks)
- **QA agents**: haiku (execution) + sonnet (fixing)
- **Code reviewer**: opus (nuanced analysis)
- **Python developer**: sonnet (balanced capability)

**Rationale**: Match model cost/capability to task complexity

**Date**: 2026-02-06

### Decision 3: Agent Team Sub-Agent Support (TBD)

**Context**: Can agent team members spawn their own sub-agents?

**Investigation Required**:
- Test in Phase 1
- Document findings
- Update plan based on results

**Status**: Decision deferred until Phase 1 testing

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Agent teams can't spawn sub-agents | High | Medium | Document limitation, main thread orchestrates for teams |
| Advisory handlers ignored | Medium | High | Monitor usage, adjust messaging, consider metrics |
| Sub-agent overhead > savings | Medium | Low | Benchmark in Phase 6, adjust strategy if needed |
| Complex orchestration confusing | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive docs, clear examples |

## Notes & Updates

### 2026-02-06 - Plan Created

**Research Summary**:
- Compaction cannot be triggered from hooks (PreCompact is observe-only)
- Manual `/compact` is only trigger mechanism
- Agents cannot spawn nested agents (architectural constraint)
- Main thread must orchestrate all agent spawning
- Existing agents: qa-runner, python-developer, qa-fixer, code-reviewer, release-agent
- Agent teams work well but no evidence of sub-agent usage by teammates

**Open Questions**:
1. Can agent team members spawn sub-agents? (Test in Phase 1)
2. What token savings can we achieve? (Measure in Phase 6)
3. Should enforcement be advisory or blocking? (Decided: advisory)

**Next Steps**:
- Begin Phase 1: Research agent team sub-agent capability
- Document findings
- Proceed based on results
