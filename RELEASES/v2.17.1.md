# Release v2.17.1 - Upgrade Skill Fix

**Release Date:** 2026-02-27
**Type:** Patch Release

## Summary

v2.17.1 fixes a bug in the `/hooks-daemon upgrade` skill wrapper that prevented all skill-based upgrades from working. The wrapper script was not passing the required `--project-root` argument to the daemon's upgrade script.

## Changes

### Fixed

- **Upgrade Skill Missing --project-root Argument**: Fixed the `/hooks-daemon upgrade` skill wrapper script failing with "ERR --project-root requires a path argument". The skill wrapper was not passing the required `--project-root` argument to the daemon's upgrade script, causing all skill-based upgrades to fail.

## Upgrade Instructions

No breaking changes. Standard upgrade procedure applies.

PATCH release — no handler changes, acceptance testing not required.

**Option 1: Using the upgrade script (recommended for this release):**

Since the `/hooks-daemon upgrade` skill itself is the bug being fixed, use the manual upgrade method:

```bash
cd .claude/hooks-daemon
git fetch --tags
git checkout v2.17.1
untracked/venv/bin/pip install -e .
untracked/venv/bin/python -m claude_code_hooks_daemon.daemon.cli restart
```

**Option 2: Scripted upgrade:**

```bash
bash .claude/hooks-daemon/scripts/upgrade.sh --project-root "$(pwd)" v2.17.1
```

After upgrading to v2.17.1, the `/hooks-daemon upgrade` skill will work correctly for future upgrades.
