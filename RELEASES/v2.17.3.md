# Release v2.17.3 - Upgrade Skill Fix

**Release Date:** 2026-02-27
**Type:** Patch Release

## Summary

v2.17.3 fixes the `/hooks-daemon upgrade` skill failing when invoked without an explicit version argument.

## Changes

### Fixed

- **Upgrade Skill Version String Bug**: Fixed the `/hooks-daemon upgrade` skill passing the literal string `"latest"` as the target version instead of resolving the actual latest release tag. When no version argument was provided, the wrapper script defaulted to `"latest"` which the daemon's upgrade script interpreted as a git tag name (which doesn't exist), rather than triggering its auto-detect logic. The invocation now conditionally omits the version argument, allowing the daemon script to auto-detect the latest tag.

## Test Results

- **Tests**: 6465 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped
- **Coverage**: 95.0%
- **QA**: 8/8 checks passed

## Upgrade Instructions

No breaking changes. Standard upgrade procedure applies.

PATCH release with no handler changes — shell script fix only.

```bash
cd .claude/hooks-daemon
git fetch --tags
git checkout v2.17.3
untracked/venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

Or using the upgrade skill (with explicit version until you have this fix):

```bash
/hooks-daemon upgrade v2.17.3
```

After upgrading, restart the daemon:

```bash
untracked/venv/bin/python -m claude_code_hooks_daemon.daemon.cli restart
```
