# Releases Directory

This directory contains comprehensive release notes for each version of the Claude Code Hooks Daemon.

## Purpose

- Preserve detailed release notes for each version
- Provide installation/upgrade instructions per release
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Serve as source for GitHub release descriptions

## File Naming

Release notes follow the pattern: `vX.Y.Z.md`

Example:
- `v2.1.0.md` - Release notes for version 2.1.0
- `v2.2.0.md` - Release notes for version 2.2.0

## Content Structure

Each release note includes:

1. **Release Summary** - Overview and type (major/minor/patch)
2. **Highlights** - 3-5 key features/fixes
3. **Full Changelog** - Complete list of changes (from CHANGELOG.md)
4. **Upgrade Instructions** - Version-specific upgrade steps
5. **Installation Commands** - For new users
6. **Testing Stats** - Test count, coverage, QA status
7. **Contributors** - Auto-generated from git log
8. **Comparison Link** - GitHub compare URL to previous version

## Automated Generation

Release notes are automatically generated by the `/release` skill:
- See `CLAUDE/development/RELEASING.md` for process details
- Uses Release Agent (`.claude/agents/release-agent.md`)
- Reviewed by Opus agent before publication

## Usage

**For Users:**
- Find your installed version: `git describe --tags` (in .claude/hooks-daemon/)
- Read release notes to understand changes
- Follow upgrade instructions if updating

**For Maintainers:**
- Run `/release` skill to generate new release notes
- Release notes automatically copied to GitHub releases
- Preserved here for offline reference

## Version History

Release notes in this directory start from v2.2.0 (when `/release` skill was introduced).

For earlier versions, see CHANGELOG.md or GitHub releases page.
