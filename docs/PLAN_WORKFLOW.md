## Overview & Philosophy

### What is Plan Workflow?

Plan Workflow is a structured approach to organizing development work through:

- **Numbered folders** (sequential, zero-padded) containing all plan-related documentation
- **Standardized PLAN.md** format with tasks, goals, decisions, and progress tracking
- **Lifecycle management** (Not Started → In Progress → Complete/Blocked/Cancelled)
- **Documentation co-location** (all supporting docs stay with the plan)
- **Archive preservation** (completed plans move to Completed/ for historical reference)

### Why Use Structured Planning?

**For Human Developers:**
- Clearer thinking through explicit task breakdown
- Visible progress tracking
- Better handoffs between team members
- Historical knowledge preservation

**For AI Assistants:**
- Context preservation across sessions
- Explicit task prioritization
- Reduced hallucination (written goals vs assumed goals)
- Better collaboration between multiple AI agents

**For Projects:**
- Architectural decision log
- Work estimation improvement over time
- Audit trail for changes
- Onboarding documentation

### Benefits Over Ad-Hoc Development

| Ad-Hoc Approach | Plan Workflow Approach |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Tasks scattered across tools/memory | Single source of truth in CLAUDE/Plan/ |
| Lost context after interruptions | State preserved in PLAN.md |
| Unclear completion criteria | Explicit success criteria |
| No decision rationale | Technical decisions documented |
| Hard to resume work | README.md index shows all active plans |

### When to Use Plans vs Simple Tasks

**Use Plan Workflow For:**
- Work taking > 2 hours
- Multi-phase implementation
- Architectural decisions needed
- Work that may be interrupted/resumed
- Coordination between multiple people/agents
- Anything with significant risk

**Use Simple Task Lists For:**
- Quick fixes (< 1 hour)
- Single-session work
- No architectural decisions
- Low risk changes
- Temporary tracking during active work

**Converting Simple Tasks to Plans:**
If your task list grows beyond 5 items or spans multiple sessions, create a proper plan and migrate the tasks.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Numbered Folders

Plans use **5-digit zero-padded sequential numbering**:

```
00001-first-feature/
00002-bug-fix/
00003-refactoring/
...
00099-another-feature/
00100-milestone-work/
```

**Why this format?**
- **Sortable**: Filesystem sorts correctly (00001 before 00002)
- **Trackable**: Easy to reference in commits ("Plan 00042: ...")
- **Scalable**: Supports 00001-99999 plans
- **Stable**: Numbers never change even if plan is cancelled

### 2. Plan Lifecycle

Every plan progresses through states:

```
Not Started → In Progress → Complete
                         ↘ Blocked
                         ↘ Cancelled
```

**Status tracking** in PLAN.md header:
```markdown
**Status**: In Progress
```

**Completion** triggers move to archive:
```bash
git mv CLAUDE/Plan/00042-feature CLAUDE/Plan/Completed/00042-feature
```

### 3. Documentation Co-location

All plan-related documents stay together:

```
00042-complex-feature/
├── PLAN.md                  # Main plan document
├── architecture-analysis.md # Supporting analysis
├── design-decisions.md      # Design exploration
├── performance-study.md     # Research findings
└── assets/
    ├── diagram.png          # Visual aids
    └── benchmark-logs.txt   # Data files
```

**Benefits:**
- No scattered documentation
- Everything moves together to Completed/
- Easy to find all context for a plan
- Historical plans remain complete

### 4. Atomic Units of Work

**One plan = one cohesive piece of work**

- Single clear goal
- Measurable success criteria
- Related tasks grouped together
- Independent completion (no cross-plan dependencies if possible)

**If a plan grows too large**, split it:
```
00050-large-feature/           → Split into:
                                 00050-feature-phase-1/
                                 00051-feature-phase-2/
                                 00052-feature-phase-3/
```

### 5. Task Status System

Plans use **emoji status indicators** for visual clarity:

| Status | Icon | Markdown | Usage |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Not Started | ⬜ | `⬜` | Task hasn't begun |
| In Progress | 🔄 | `🔄` | Currently working |
| Completed | ✅ | `✅` | Done and verified |
| Blocked | 🚫 | `🚫` | Cannot proceed |
| Cancelled | ❌ | `❌` | No longer needed |
| On Hold | ⏸️ | `⏸️` | Paused temporarily |
| Needs Review | 👁️ | `👁️` | Awaiting review |

**Example:**
```markdown
### Phase 1: Implementation
- [ ] ⬜ **Setup environment**
  - [ ] 🔄 Install dependencies
  - [ ] ✅ Configure tooling
  - [ ] 🚫 Setup CI (blocked: credentials needed)
```

## Handlers Supporting Plan Workflow

The Claude Code Hooks Daemon includes handlers that enforce and support the Plan Workflow system:

### 1. MarkdownOrganizationHandler

**Event**: PostToolUse (Write/Edit)
**Priority**: 40
**Type**: Blocking

**Purpose**: Enforces markdown file organization rules, including CLAUDE/Plan/ structure.

**What it does**:
- Allows markdown files in approved locations (CLAUDE/Plan/, docs/, etc.)
- Blocks markdown files outside approved locations
- Allows edits to PLAN.md and supporting docs within plan folders
- Allows Completed/, Cancelled/, Archive/ subdirectories
- Intercepts Claude Code planning mode writes and redirects to project structure

**Configuration**:
```yaml
handlers:
  post_tool_use:
    markdown_organization:
      enabled: true
      priority: 40
      track_plans_in_project: "CLAUDE/Plan"
      plan_workflow_docs: "CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md"
```

**Example block**:
```
🚫 BLOCKED: Markdown files must be in approved locations

Allowed locations:
- CLAUDE/ (documentation)
- docs/ (project docs)
- CLAUDE/Plan/ (plan documents)

Blocked: random-notes.md in project root

Move to: CLAUDE/random-notes.md or docs/notes.md
```

### 2. WorkflowStatePreCompactHandler

**Event**: PreCompact
**Priority**: 50
**Type**: Non-blocking (context injection)

**Purpose**: Preserves workflow state before context compaction.

**What it does**:
- Detects if agent is in a formal workflow (active plan with "In Progress" status)
- Saves workflow state to `untracked/workflow-state/{workflow-name}/state-{workflow-name}-{timestamp}.json`
- Extracts plan number, current phase, required reading list
- State file persists across compaction cycles

**Why this matters**:
- AI context gets compressed during long sessions
- Without state preservation, AI forgets which plan it's working on
- State file enables restoration after compaction

**State file format**:
```json
{
  "workflow": "Plan 00042: Feature Implementation",
  "workflow_type": "handler_implementation",
  "phase": {
    "current": 2,
    "total": 4,
    "name": "TDD Implementation",
    "status": "in_progress"
  },
  "required_reading": [
    "@CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md",
    "@CLAUDE/Plan/00042-feature/PLAN.md"
  ],
  "context": {
    "plan_number": 42,
    "plan_name": "00042-feature"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-02-17T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### 3. WorkflowStateRestorationHandler

**Event**: SessionStart (source=compact)
**Priority**: Default
**Type**: Non-blocking (advisory)

**Purpose**: Restores workflow state after compaction.

**What it does**:
- Fires when session resumes after context compaction
- Reads most recent workflow state file
- Provides advisory with required reading list (using @ syntax)
- Forces AI to re-read plan documents before continuing

**Example advisory**:
```
⚠️ WORKFLOW RESTORED AFTER COMPACTION ⚠️

Workflow: Plan 00042: Feature Implementation
Type: handler_implementation
Phase: 2/4 - TDD Implementation (in_progress)

REQUIRED READING (read ALL now with @ syntax):
@CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md
@CLAUDE/Plan/00042-feature/PLAN.md

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Read ALL files listed above using @ syntax
2. Confirm understanding of workflow phase
3. DO NOT proceed with assumptions or hallucinated logic
```

### 4. PlanCompletionAdvisorHandler

**Event**: PreToolUse (Write/Edit)
**Priority**: 36
**Type**: Non-blocking (advisory)

**Purpose**: Reminds agent to properly close out completed plans.

**What it does**:
- Detects edits to PLAN.md that change status to "Complete"
- Provides advisory about completion steps:
  - Move folder to Completed/
  - Update README.md (remove from Active, add to Completed)
  - Update plan statistics

**Example advisory**:
```
Plan 00042-feature appears to be marked as complete. Remember to:
1. Move to Completed/: git mv CLAUDE/Plan/00042-feature CLAUDE/Plan/Completed/
2. Update CLAUDE/Plan/README.md (move from Active to Completed section, update link path)
3. Update plan statistics in README.md (increment Completed count, update total)
```

### 5. GitContextInjectorHandler (Optional)

**Event**: UserPromptSubmit
**Priority**: 50
**Type**: Non-blocking (advisory)

**Purpose**: Suggests referencing plan numbers in git commits.

**Commit message format**:
```
Plan 00042: Implement feature X

- Add handler for Y
- Include tests for Z

Refs: CLAUDE/Plan/00042-feature/PLAN.md
```

## Setting Up Plan Workflow

### Prerequisites

1. **Git repository** (plan folders tracked in version control)
2. **Claude Code Hooks Daemon installed** (optional but recommended for handler support)
3. **Markdown editor** (any text editor works)

### Step 1: Install Hooks Daemon (Optional)

The hooks daemon provides automated enforcement and context preservation. See [Installation Guide](../CLAUDE/LLM-INSTALL.md).

**Quick install**:
```bash
cd .claude
git clone https://github.com/Edmonds-Commerce-Limited/claude-code-hooks-daemon.git hooks-daemon
cd hooks-daemon
git checkout v2.13.0  # Use latest stable version
python3 -m venv untracked/venv
untracked/venv/bin/pip install -e .
untracked/venv/bin/python install.py
cd ../..
```

### Step 2: Initialize Directory Structure

```bash
# Create plan directory structure
mkdir -p CLAUDE/Plan/{Completed,Cancelled,Archive}

# Create index file
cat > CLAUDE/Plan/README.md << 'EOF'
# Plans Index

## Active Plans

- None yet

## Completed Plans

- None yet

## Plan Statistics

- **Total Plans Created**: 0
- **Active**: 0
- **Completed**: 0
EOF

# Create lifecycle instructions
cat > CLAUDE/Plan/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Plan Lifecycle

See @CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md for full planning workflow.

## Quick Reference

- **Create**: CLAUDE/Plan/NNNNN-description/
- **Execute**: Update task status as you work
- **Complete**: Move to Completed/, update README.md
EOF
```

### Step 3: Copy Plan Template

Save the [Plan Document Template](#plan-document-template) as `CLAUDE/Plan/TEMPLATE.md` for easy reference.

### Step 4: Configure Handlers (If Using Daemon)

Edit `.claude/hooks-daemon.yaml`:

```yaml
handlers:
  post_tool_use:
    markdown_organization:
      enabled: true
      priority: 40
      track_plans_in_project: "CLAUDE/Plan"
      plan_workflow_docs: "CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md"

  pre_compact:
    workflow_state_pre_compact:
      enabled: true
      priority: 50

  session_start:
    workflow_state_restoration:
      enabled: true

  pre_tool_use:
    plan_completion_advisor:
      enabled: true
      priority: 36
```

### Step 5: Create Your First Plan

```bash
# Create plan folder
mkdir -p CLAUDE/Plan/00001-my-first-feature

# Copy template
cp CLAUDE/Plan/TEMPLATE.md CLAUDE/Plan/00001-my-first-feature/PLAN.md

# Edit plan (fill in overview, goals, tasks)
# Then update README.md to add plan to Active Plans section
```

### Step 6: Git Integration

Add to `.gitignore`:
```
# Plan workflow state (generated files)
untracked/workflow-state/
```

Add to `.git/info/exclude` (or `.gitignore` if shared):
```
# Plan drafts and work-in-progress notes
CLAUDE/Plan/*/DRAFT-*.md
CLAUDE/Plan/*/NOTES-*.md
```

## Customization Guide

### Project-Specific Adaptations

The Plan Workflow concept is flexible - adapt it to your project's needs:

#### Different Folder Structure

**Instead of `CLAUDE/Plan/`**, use what fits your project:

```
# Technical project
docs/plans/

# Product project
product/plans/

# Research project
research/experiments/
```

**Update handler config** if using daemon:
```yaml
handlers:
  post_tool_use:
    markdown_organization:
      track_plans_in_project: "docs/plans"
```

#### Custom Numbering Scheme

**3-digit numbering** for smaller projects:
```
001-feature/
002-bugfix/
...
999-milestone/
```

**Date-based numbering** for research projects:
```
2026-02-17-experiment-a/
2026-02-18-experiment-b/
```

**Key principle**: Whatever scheme you choose, be consistent.

#### Modified Templates

Add project-specific sections:

**For API projects**:
```markdown
## API Changes

- Endpoints added: [list]
- Endpoints modified: [list]
- Breaking changes: [list]
- Migration guide: [link]
```

**For UI projects**:
```markdown
## Design Review

- Figma link: [url]
- Design review date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Approved by: [name]
- Design notes: [description]
```

**For data projects**:
```markdown
## Data Impact

- Tables affected: [list]
- Migration required: Yes/No
- Data validation: [approach]
- Rollback plan: [steps]
```

#### Task Tracking Integration

**Jira integration**:
```markdown
## Tasks

### Phase 1: Implementation
- [ ] ⬜ **Task 1**: [Description] (JIRA-123)
- [ ] ⬜ **Task 2**: [Description] (JIRA-124)
```

**GitHub Issues integration**:
```markdown
**GitHub Issue**: #42

## Tasks
- [ ] ⬜ **Fix bug X** (refs #42)
```

#### Additional Supporting Doc Types

Add project-specific supporting docs:

```
00042-feature/
├── PLAN.md
├── API-SPEC.md          # API documentation
├── DATABASE-SCHEMA.md   # Schema changes
├── PERFORMANCE.md       # Performance analysis
├── SECURITY.md          # Security considerations
└── ROLLBACK-PLAN.md     # Rollback procedures
```

### Language-Specific Adaptations

**Python projects** - Add QA requirements:
```markdown
## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests passing (pytest)
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] Type checking passes (mypy strict)
- [ ] Linting passes (ruff)
- [ ] Formatting correct (black)
```

**JavaScript projects** - Add build checks:
```markdown
## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests passing (jest)
- [ ] ESLint passes with zero warnings
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] Build passes (npm run build)
- [ ] Bundle size within limits
```

**Go projects** - Add Go-specific checks:
```markdown
## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests passing (go test)
- [ ] go vet passes
- [ ] golangci-lint passes
- [ ] go mod tidy clean
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Plan Creation

**Good plan titles**:
```
✅ 00042-add-user-authentication
✅ 00043-fix-memory-leak-in-parser
✅ 00044-refactor-database-layer
```

**Bad plan titles**:
```
❌ 00042-stuff
❌ 00043-fix-things
❌ 00044-update
```

**When to create a plan**:
- Work will take > 2 hours
- Multiple related tasks
- Requires architectural decisions
- May be interrupted/resumed
- Needs documentation for others

**When NOT to create a plan**:
- Quick fixes (< 1 hour)
- Simple typo corrections
- Single-file changes with no design decisions
- Temporary experimental work

### 2. Task Writing

**Good tasks** (specific, actionable, testable):
```markdown
✅ **Create user authentication handler**
  - [ ] Write failing test for login validation
  - [ ] Implement password hashing (bcrypt)
  - [ ] Add JWT token generation
  - [ ] Test with real user database
  - [ ] Update API documentation

✅ **Fix memory leak in parser** (max 30 minutes)
  - [ ] Profile parser with heap analysis
  - [ ] Identify leak source
  - [ ] Implement fix
  - [ ] Verify with profiler
```

**Bad tasks** (vague, non-actionable):
```markdown
❌ **Fix the system**
❌ **Make it better**
❌ **Work on authentication**
```

**Task granularity**:
- **Task**: 15-60 minutes of focused work
- **Subtask**: 5-15 minutes of specific action
- **Phase**: Group of related tasks (hours/days)

### 3. Status Update Discipline

**Update frequently**:
```markdown
# Morning: Start work
- [ ] 🔄 **Task 1**: Currently implementing

# Afternoon: Hit blocker
- [ ] 🚫 **Task 1**: Blocked - waiting for API key

# Next day: Blocker resolved
- [ ] ✅ **Task 1**: Complete - tested and working
```

**Rules**:
1. **Limit work in progress**: Max 1-2 tasks marked 🔄 at a time
2. **Update immediately**: Change status as soon as state changes
3. **Document blocks**: If 🚫, add note explaining why
4. **Verify completion**: Only ✅ after testing/verification

### 4. Handling Changes

**When requirements change mid-plan**:

```markdown
## Notes & Updates

### 2026-02-10 - Scope Change
Original goal was X, but stakeholder requested Y instead.

**Impact**:
- Added 2 new tasks to Phase 2
- Removed Task 3.1 (no longer needed)
- Timeline extended by 2 days

**Decision**: Proceed with revised scope (approved by stakeholder)
```

**When to split a plan**:
- Original estimate was way off (2x+ longer)
- Natural breakpoint discovered
- Part can ship independently
- Different priorities emerge

**How to split**:
```bash
# Original: 00042-large-feature (too big)

# Split into:
git mv CLAUDE/Plan/00042-large-feature CLAUDE/Plan/00042-feature-phase-1

# Create new plans:
mkdir CLAUDE/Plan/00043-feature-phase-2
mkdir CLAUDE/Plan/00044-feature-phase-3

# Update dependencies in each PLAN.md
```

### 5. Completion Checklist

**Before marking plan complete**:

- [ ] All tasks marked ✅
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review complete (if applicable)
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production
- [ ] Post-mortem notes added (what went well, what didn't)

**Completion workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Update PLAN.md status
# Change: **Status**: In Progress
# To:     **Status**: Complete (2026-02-17)

# 2. Move to Completed
git mv CLAUDE/Plan/00042-feature CLAUDE/Plan/Completed/00042-feature

# 3. Update README.md
# - Remove from Active Plans
# - Add to Completed Plans with summary
# - Update statistics (increment Completed count)

# 4. Commit
git add CLAUDE/Plan/
git commit -m "Plan 00042: Complete - Feature X implementation

All tasks complete, tests passing, deployed to production.
See Completed/00042-feature/PLAN.md for full details."
```

### 6. Plan Reviews

**Daily review** (if actively working on plan):
- Are tasks up to date?
- Any blockers need attention?
- Is plan still on track?
- Any scope changes needed?

**Weekly review** (for active plans):
- Progress vs timeline?
- Dependencies still valid?
- Risks materialized?
- Lessons learned so far?

**Completion review**:
- All success criteria met?
- Lessons learned documented?
- Follow-up work identified?
- Knowledge transferred?

### Example 1: Simple Feature Plan

```markdown
# Plan 00042: Add Dark Mode Toggle

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-17)
**Created**: 2026-02-15
**Owner**: AI Assistant
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours
**Actual Effort**: 3.5 hours

## Overview

Add a dark mode toggle to the application UI. Users have requested a dark theme option to reduce eye strain during nighttime usage.

## Goals

- Add toggle switch to settings page
- Persist user preference in localStorage
- Support system-level dark mode preference detection
- Apply dark theme to all existing components

## Non-Goals

- Custom color scheme selection (use standard dark theme)
- Dark mode for marketing pages (product UI only)
- Automatic time-based switching

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Design
- [x] ✅ **Review existing color palette**
- [x] ✅ **Define dark mode CSS variables**
- [x] ✅ **Create toggle component mockup**

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [x] ✅ **Create DarkModeToggle component**
  - [x] ✅ Write component tests
  - [x] ✅ Implement toggle UI
  - [x] ✅ Add accessibility labels
- [x] ✅ **Add theme context provider**
  - [x] ✅ Implement useTheme hook
  - [x] ✅ Add localStorage persistence
  - [x] ✅ Detect system preference
- [x] ✅ **Update CSS variables for dark mode**
- [x] ✅ **Test all components in dark mode**

### Phase 3: Polish

### Example 2: Complex Refactoring Plan

```markdown
# Plan 00043: Refactor Database Layer to Repository Pattern

**Status**: In Progress
**Created**: 2026-02-10
**Owner**: Development Team
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks

## Overview

The current database layer has direct SQL queries scattered across business logic. This makes testing difficult and creates tight coupling. Refactor to use Repository Pattern with clean separation of concerns.

## Goals

- Centralize all database queries in repository classes
- Enable easy mocking for unit tests
- Support multiple database backends (PostgreSQL, SQLite for tests)
- Improve query performance with proper indexing

## Non-Goals

- ORM migration (stick with raw SQL for performance)
- GraphQL API layer (separate project)
- Database schema changes (schema stays the same)

## Context & Background

Current pain points:
- Business logic mixed with SQL queries
- Difficult to unit test without database
- Query duplication across controllers
- No query performance monitoring

See `database-analysis.md` for detailed audit of current state.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Design (Week 1)
- [x] ✅ **Audit existing database queries**
  - [x] ✅ Find all direct SQL usage (49 locations found)
  - [x] ✅ Group by entity type (User, Order, Product, etc.)
  - [x] ✅ Document current query patterns
- [x] ✅ **Design repository interface**
  - [x] ✅ Define base Repository<T> interface
  - [x] ✅ Design UserRepository interface
  - [x] ✅ Design OrderRepository interface
  - [x] ✅ Get team review and approval
- [x] ✅ **Create migration plan**
  - [x] ✅ Determine migration order (least coupled first)
  - [x] ✅ Plan feature flag strategy
  - [x] ✅ Define rollback procedures

### Phase 2: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [x] ✅ **Implement base repository infrastructure**
  - [x] ✅ Create Repository<T> base class
  - [x] ✅ Add connection pool management
  - [x] ✅ Implement query logging
  - [x] ✅ Add performance monitoring
- [ ] 🔄 **Implement UserRepository**
  - [x] ✅ Write repository interface
  - [x] ✅ Implement PostgreSQL version
  - [ ] 🔄 Implement SQLite version (for tests)
  - [ ] ⬜ Write comprehensive tests
  - [ ] ⬜ Migrate user-related queries

### Phase 3: Entity Repositories (Week 2-3)
- [ ] ⬜ **Implement OrderRepository**
- [ ] ⬜ **Implement ProductRepository**
- [ ] ⬜ **Implement CategoryRepository**
- [ ] ⬜ **Implement PaymentRepository**

### Phase 4: Migration (Week 3)
- [ ] ⬜ **Migrate business logic layer**
  - [ ] ⬜ Update UserController to use UserRepository
  - [ ] ⬜ Update OrderController to use OrderRepository
  - [ ] ⬜ Update remaining controllers
- [ ] ⬜ **Remove old database layer**
  - [ ] ⬜ Delete legacy query helpers
  - [ ] ⬜ Update documentation
  - [ ] ⬜ Remove feature flags

### Phase 5: Optimization (Week 3)
- [ ] ⬜ **Add query optimization**
  - [ ] ⬜ Review slow query log
  - [ ] ⬜ Add missing indexes
  - [ ] ⬜ Optimize N+1 queries
- [ ] ⬜ **Load testing**
  - [ ] ⬜ Benchmark before/after performance
  - [ ] ⬜ Verify no regressions

## Dependencies

- Blocks: Plan 00044 (GraphQL API - needs clean data layer)
- Related: Plan 00040 (Testing improvements - benefits from mockable repos)

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Repository Pattern vs Active Record

**Context**: Need better separation of concerns and testability

**Options Considered**:
1. Repository Pattern - Separate data access layer with interfaces
2. Active Record - Entities know how to persist themselves
3. Data Mapper ORM - Use full ORM like SQLAlchemy

**Decision**: Repository Pattern because:
- Clean separation enables easy testing
- Supports multiple DB backends cleanly
- Keeps business logic decoupled from persistence
- No ORM overhead (we need raw SQL performance)

**Date**: 2026-02-10

### Decision 2: Generic Repository<T> vs Specific Repositories

**Context**: Should we have a base generic repository or only specific ones?

**Options Considered**:
1. Generic Repository<T> with common CRUD operations
2. Only specific repositories (UserRepository, etc.) with custom methods

**Decision**: Hybrid approach:
- Generic Repository<T> base class with common operations (findById, save, delete)
- Specific repositories extend base and add entity-specific queries
- Balance between DRY and type safety

**Date**: 2026-02-11

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All SQL queries moved to repository classes
- [ ] Zero direct database access in business logic
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for repositories
- [ ] Unit tests can run without database (using mocks)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no regression
- [ ] Documentation updated with new architecture
- [ ] Team trained on repository pattern

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Performance regression | High | Medium | Benchmark each repository, rollback if slower |
| Breaking existing features | High | Low | Feature flags, gradual rollout, extensive testing |
| Team adoption issues | Medium | Medium | Training sessions, pair programming, code reviews |
| Timeline overrun | Medium | High | Start with smallest repositories, learn as we go |

## Timeline

- Week 1 (Feb 10-14): Design + Foundation
- Week 2 (Feb 17-21): UserRepository migration + additional repos
- Week 3 (Feb 24-28): Remaining migrations + optimization
- Target Completion: 2026-02-28

### Example 3: Bug Fix Plan

```markdown
# Plan 00045: Fix Memory Leak in Event Processing

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-16)
**Created**: 2026-02-15
**Owner**: Performance Team
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Actual Effort**: 6 hours

**GitHub Issue**: #287

## Overview

Production monitoring shows memory usage growing unbounded in event processing service. Memory grows by ~50MB/hour, eventually causing OOM crashes after 24-48 hours of uptime.

## Goals

- Identify source of memory leak
- Implement fix
- Verify leak is resolved with profiling
- Deploy fix to production

## Non-Goals

- General performance optimization (separate effort)
- Event processing refactoring (not needed)

## Context & Background

**Symptom**: Memory usage grows continuously, never levels off
**Impact**: Service crashes every 24-48 hours, requires restart
**First observed**: 2026-02-10 (after v2.5.0 deployment)
**Potential cause**: Recent changes to event listener registration

See `memory-profile-analysis.md` for detailed profiling data.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Investigation
- [x] ✅ **Reproduce locally**
  - [x] ✅ Set up monitoring
  - [x] ✅ Run service with profiling enabled
  - [x] ✅ Confirm memory growth
- [x] ✅ **Profile with heap analysis**
  - [x] ✅ Take heap dumps at intervals
  - [x] ✅ Compare snapshots
  - [x] ✅ Identify growing objects
- [x] ✅ **Identify leak source**
  - [x] ✅ Found: EventListener instances not being garbage collected
  - [x] ✅ Root cause: Missing removeListener calls

### Phase 2: Fix
- [x] ✅ **Write failing test**
  - [x] ✅ Test that listeners are removed after use
  - [x] ✅ Test that memory doesn't grow unbounded
- [x] ✅ **Implement fix**
  - [x] ✅ Add removeListener calls in cleanup paths
  - [x] ✅ Add WeakMap for listener tracking
  - [x] ✅ Add automated cleanup timer
- [x] ✅ **Verify fix with profiling**
  - [x] ✅ Run service for 4 hours
  - [x] ✅ Confirm memory stays flat
  - [x] ✅ No OOM crashes

### Phase 3: Deploy
- [x] ✅ **Deploy to staging**
  - [x] ✅ Monitor for 2 hours
  - [x] ✅ Verify no issues
- [x] ✅ **Deploy to production**
  - [x] ✅ Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
  - [x] ✅ Monitor memory metrics
  - [x] ✅ Confirm leak resolved

## Success Criteria

- [x] Memory leak identified with profiling
- [x] Root cause documented
- [x] Fix implemented with tests
- [x] Memory usage stable over 4+ hours
- [x] Deployed to production
- [x] No OOM crashes observed
- [x] GitHub issue #287 closed

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: WeakMap vs Manual Tracking

**Context**: How to track listeners for cleanup

**Options Considered**:
1. WeakMap - Automatic garbage collection
2. Manual tracking with cleanup timer
3. Immediate removeListener calls only

**Decision**: WeakMap + cleanup timer because:
- WeakMap prevents memory leaks even if cleanup fails
- Cleanup timer provides defense-in-depth
- Immediate calls might be missed in error paths

**Date**: 2026-02-15

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need the hooks daemon to use Plan Workflow?**
A: No. The plan workflow concept (numbered folders, PLAN.md structure) works with any editor and git. The hooks daemon adds automation (enforcement, context preservation) but isn't required.

**Q: Can I use plan workflow with other AI assistants (ChatGPT, etc.)?**
A: Yes. The plan structure is tool-agnostic. Only the handlers are specific to Claude Code with the hooks daemon.

**Q: How do I migrate existing work to plan workflow?**
A: Create plans for active work, backfill for important historical work. Start fresh rather than migrating everything.

**Q: What if my team prefers Jira/Linear/etc?**
A: Plans complement issue trackers. Use trackers for team coordination, plans for detailed implementation tracking. Link them together.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I handle cross-plan dependencies?**
A: Document in Dependencies section. If tightly coupled, consider merging plans.

**Q: Can I have multiple active plans simultaneously?**
A: Yes, but limit to 2-3 per person to maintain focus.

**Q: Should I create a plan for documentation updates?**
A: Only if substantial (> 2 hours). Simple doc fixes don't need plans.

**Q: How do I handle plans that span sprints/milestones?**
A: Break into multiple plans (one per sprint) or use phases within a single plan.

### Workflow Questions

**Q: What if I need to pause a plan?**
A: Mark status as "⏸️ On Hold", add note explaining why, update when resuming.

**Q: How do I handle abandoned/outdated plans?**
A: Mark as "Cancelled" with reason, move to Completed/ (cancelled plans still preserved).

**Q: Should I update completed plans with new information?**
A: No. Completed plans are historical record. Create new plan if work resumes.

**Q: How detailed should task breakdowns be?**
A: Detailed enough that someone else (or future you) can understand and continue the work.
